Cinder-Async
================

Simple utility block to call functions on the background and get a callback when they are done. Attempts to make use of GCD on Mac/iOS and std::async on Windows.
Built for the (https://github.com/cinder/Cinder)[Cinder library] for creative coding, version 0.9.0. Only tested on Mac OS X.
